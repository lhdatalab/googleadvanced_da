Google Advanced Data Analytics capstone project

This project looked at HR data for  a fictionalized company Salifort Motors. Due to high turnover rate, build a classification model to predict if an employee will leave the company.

Two models were built - a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest model. The model with the highest F1 score was chosen.
