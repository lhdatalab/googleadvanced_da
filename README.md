Google Advanced Data Analytics capstone project

This project looked at HR data for  a fictionalized company Salifort Motors. Due to high turnover rate, build a classification model to predict if an employee will leave the company.

Two models were built - a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest model. The model with the highest F1 score was chosen.

### Overview
The goal of the project was to compare the performance of a logistic regression and random forest model to predict employee turnover.
The project utilized the HR data from a fictionalized company Salifort Motors.
The final model chosen was random forest with an F1 score of 95.6%, 98.5% precision, and 93% recall.
Important features in determining the employees leaving the company are satisfaction levels, number of projects, last evaluation, tenure, and average monthly hours.

### Business Understanding
Salifort wants to create a corporate culture that supports employee success and professional development. However, currently there is a high turnover rate of employees. This high turnover rate is financially costly as the company makes a big investment in recruiting, training, and upskilling its employees. It is important to understande what causes employees to leave the company.
